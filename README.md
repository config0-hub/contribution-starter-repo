# starter repo

This repository serves as an empty space where you can add your OpenTofu-based code. It is structured with three main folders designed for file insertion:

- `shellouts/_config0_configs/`: This folder contains a sample script for installing `kubectl` specifically for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

- `execgroups/_config0_configs/`: Here, you will find an example of copying a simple Terraform code for creating an EC2 server, named "__ec2_server__".

- `stacks/_config0_configs/`: This folder includes a sample for creating a stack (entry point) called "__aws_ec2_server__" for the `execgroup` "__ec2_server__".

This repository is dedicated to the conversion of your OpenTofu-based code into immutable workflows. These workflows are designed to be launchable and shareable for others to utilize. By leveraging the features and capabilities of this repository, you can transform your code into self-contained and reproducible workflows that can be easily executed and distributed among users.
